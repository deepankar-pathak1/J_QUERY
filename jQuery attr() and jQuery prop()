Difference between jQuery attr() and jQuery prop() method:
This is a very common question because most of the people are confused about where to use prop() method and where attr() method. The differences between them are very important in specific situation.

Following is the exact differences between them:

The jQuery attr() method is used to retrieve the HTML attribute values while jQuery prop() method is used to retrieve the property values.
The attr() method changes the attribute of the HTML tag while the prop() method changes a property for the HTML tag as per the DOM tree.
Properties are generally simpler to deal with than attributes so the jQuery prop() method is mostly used rather than attr() method.
